			Part 9 contains the HVCS clearing and settlement rules which specify the requirements for participants
			to create, exchange, settle, deliver and receive HVCS instructions and make HVCS payments (including
			SCPs) through HVCS. Part 2 contains the access and participation rules for an entity to join HVCS.</p>
                    <p>Participants should also carefully read Parts 1, 15 and 19 of the Payments NZ Rules to fully
			understand the operation of the HVCS Clearing and Settlement Rules.  Parts 5, 9-11A, 14 and 16-18 may
			also be relevant to HVCS instructions in certain circumstances.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the Rules, the applicable HVCS standards (Appendix 14) which specify how participants
			comply with Part 9 are comprised of:</p>

                    <p>The Bank will submit the same day cleared payment for processing on the same Business Day
			that the Bank receives the payment instruction from you. Unless you request otherwise, it
			will generally do this within [one hour] of receipt of your payment instruction. However,

                    <p>The Bank may change these fees from time to time by giving you at least 14 days&apos; notice or

                    <p>Where you have requested that the Bank provides the notifications in (a) and/or (b) above,

                    <p>The Bank will take reasonable steps to remedy the mistake and refund you any fees paid for the
