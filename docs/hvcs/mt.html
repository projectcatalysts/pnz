        <div>This document discusses the MT Messaging Procedures that apply to HVCS instructions.</div>
        <div>This document is divided into six chapters.</div>
        <div>Chapter 1 provides an overview of the MT messages that are in scope and the explains the message lifecycle.</div>
        <div>Chapter 2 specifies how to format block 3 (user header) of the SWIFT message header.</div>
        <div>Chapter 3 specifies how to format customer credit transfers.</div>
        <div>Chapter 4 specifies how to format cross border redirections.</div>
        <div>Chapter 5 specifies how to format financial institution transfers.</div>
        <div>Chapter 6 specifies the format of the notification messages that FINCopy sends to an HVCS instructing agent and provides the ESAS rejection codes for AVP.</div>

        <div>identifies the message as an AVP message using the AVP code indicator in field 103 of the user header block 3,</div>
        <div>checks that the instructing agent and the instructed agent are AVP MT CUG members, and</div>
        <div>validates the message content against the AVP MT CUG Service Profile on receipt.</div>
        <div>rejects the message (step 3a)</div>
        <div>holds the payment message in the instructed agent’s store and forward queue,</div>
        <div>copies information from the payment message as defined in the service profile, and</div>
        <div>sends a settlement request to ESAS in the form of an MT096-FINCopy to server destination message (step 3b)</div>
        <div>validates the structure of the MT096 message, and</div>
        <div>if the structure is not valid, stops processing the message but does not notify FINCopy, and</div>
        <div>if the structure is valid, applies business rules to validate the content of the message, by for example, checking that:</div>
        <div>ESAS:</div>
        <div>the HVCS payment is eligible for settlement</div>
        <div>ESAS sends an MT097 FINCopy message authorisation/refusal notification message to FINCopy containing the ESAS rejection code of the first error that ESAS finds during business rules validation (see clause 6.4, ESAS rejection codes) (step 5a).</div>
        <div>FinCopy sends an MT019 -abort notification message - to the instructing agent containing the ESAS rejection code in field tag 432 (step 5b).</div>
        <div>FinCopy deletes the original unsettled payment message (MT103, MT202, MT202COV, MT205, or MT205COV) from the queue.</div>
        <div>FINCopy does not notify the intended instructed agent that ESAS has rejected the settlement request.</div>
        <div>ESAS debits the instructing agent&apos;s account and credits the instructed agent&apos;s account with the amount of the HVCS payment (step 6).</div>
        <div>ESAS sends an MT097 FINCopy message authorisation/refusal notification message with the ESAS settlement reference to SWIFT confirming settlement (step 7).</div>
        <div>SWIFT FINCopy releases the payment message (MT103, MT202, MT202COV, MT205, or MT205COV) to the instructed agent and includes the settlement date/time and ESA reference in field tag 115 (step 8).</div>
        <div>SWIFT FINCopy sends an MT012 -instructing agent notification message - to the instructing agent confirming settlement and includes the settlement date/time and ESA reference in field tag 114 (step 9).</div>
        <div>If required by the original MT103, SWIFT FIN sends an MT011 - delivery notification message - to the instructing agent confirming the payment message is delivered to the instructed agent (step 9a)</div>
        <div>Instructed agent validates the payment message and either credits the creditor’s account or, if the payment message contains errors, returns the HVCS payment or amends the HVCS instruction (step 10).</div>
        <div>by debtor or at ESAS end of day (08.30))</div>
        <div>ESAS sends an MT097 - FINCopy message authorisation/refusal notification message - to FINCopy containing ESAS rejection code 60 or 62 (refer to clause 6.4, ESAS rejection codes) (step 5a).</div>
        <div>The AVP MT CUG transaction delivery system will cancel the payment message.</div>
        <div>The AVP MT CUG transaction delivery system sends an MT019 abort notification message to the instructing agent containing ESAS rejection code 60 or 62 in field tag 432 (step 5b).</div>
        <div>FinCopy deletes the original unsettled payment message (MT103, MT202, MT202COV, MT205, or MT205COV) from the queue</div>
        <div>FINCopy does not notify the intended instructed agent that ESAS has rejected the settlement request.</div>
