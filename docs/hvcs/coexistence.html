        <div>This document discusses the obligations that apply to participants during the co-existence period.</div>
        <div>This document is divided into five chapters.</div>
        <div>Chapter 1 provides defined terms, an overview of the HVCS instructions that are in scope during co-existence, the migration timeline and the obligations to send and receive HVCS instructions that apply to participants.</div>
        <div> Chapter 2 provides information on how to join the MX CUG and specifies the types of BICs that can be used in the MT and MX CUGs during</div>
        <div>co-existence.</div>
        <div>Chapter 3 provides an overview on the New Zealand HVCS’s approach to structured data during co-existence, and the approach of CBPR+.</div>
        <div>Chapter 4 explains the expectations for intermediaries during co-existence and provides an overview on data truncation.</div>
        <div>Chapter 5 provides information on SWIFT’s Transaction Manager.</div>

            <ol class="level1">
                <li>For MT messages, the Test and Production environments require different log in credentials and make use of different BICs in addressing. Together, these safeguards have acted to ensure test messages do not escape into production, as they would fail validation and immediately be stopped.</li>
                <li>In contrast, the MX test (pilot) service requires log in to a SWIFT production environment and uses a published BIC8. The traditional addressing safeguards have been replaced with the Distinguished Name (DN) specified in the Interact Header to address messages to the participant’s correct test environment. This means that both test and production messages contain a live BIC and there is greater potential for messages to be directed into the wrong environment.</li>
                <li>Participants must ensure that their processes and systems have sufficient protections to ensure test messages using live BICs do not escape into production, particularly when making technical changes, such as routing changes.</li>
                <li>The BIC is combined with the Service Name in the SWIFTNet Header (Network Header) of an InterAct message, to ensure correct addressing and separation of test and production traffic.</li>

            <ol class="level1">
                <li>The move to structured data in MX messages will remove ambiguity around the meaning of the information contained in HVCS instructions resulting in better quality data for screening and identifying customer behaviour. This should lead to improved fraud detection, and richer remittance, name and address information.</li>
                <li>Domestically, it is recommended that participants review their processes relating to obtaining customer data and acquire any additional customer data needed to ensure all ISO 20022 schema elements needed to provide structured name and address information are captured.</li>
                <li>The following list outlines the agreed approach to use of structured data within HVCS instructions (across remittance, name and address elements) for New Zealand’s HVCS:</li>
                <ol class="level2">
                    <li>During the co-existence phase:</li>
                    <ol class="level3">
                        <li>Participants must be able to receive and process MX messages that contain Unstructured Address Line formatting.</li>
                        <li>If an HVCS instruction using an MT message is converted to an MX message, the MX message must contain Unstructured Address Line formatting.</li>
                        <li>Sending MX messages containing Structured Postal Address formatting is recommended.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <li>From the scheduled date of mandated use of MX messaging (the end of the co-existence phase), the capability to send MX messages containing Unstructured Address Line formatting will be removed from the MX specification; therefore, participants must be able to send and receive MX messages containing Structured Postal Address formatting for HVCS instructions.</li>
                </ol>

                    <li>If a FIN message is converted to a CBPR+ message, the CBPR+ message must contain Unstructured Address Line formatting.</li>
                    <li>During the co-existence phase, if a payment instruction is initiated by the debtor agent using a CBPR+ message, it is highly recommended that the CBPR+ message uses Structured Postal Address formatting for the debtor and creditor.</li>
                    <li>At the end of the co-existence phase, the capability to send CBPR+ messages containing Unstructured Address formatting will be removed from the CBPR+ Usage Guidelines. Therefore, by the end of the co-existence phase, all participants that act as intermediaries must be able to send and receive CBPR+ messages containing Structured Postal Address formatting.</li>

                            <li>During the co-existence phase, participants acting as an intermediary are required to adhere to the principle ‘send on what you receive’ which requires participants to on-send payment message data in the same format it is received.</li>
                            <li>This principle removes the risk of data truncation. It is acceptable to on-send an MX payment message that was received as an MT payment message or FIN message as translating MT to MX for on-sending results in no data loss. Except for return messages, it is not acceptable to on-send an MT payment message that was received as an MX payment message or a CPBR+ message as not all MX data can be included in an MT message when translating from MX to MT. The principle also enables agents further down the payment chain to meet their compliance obligations more easily.</li>
                            <li>This means for intermediaries that receive incoming cross-border payments in CBPR+ that, subject to clause 1.7(7)(a)(iv) of these Co-existence Procedures, it will be mandatory to be able to pass those messages in full (on-send), as an MX message from the beginning of the co-existence phase if they are to be processed in the NZ HVCS.</li>
                            <li>It is recommended that participants who act as intermediaries ensure they review their terms and conditions with their customers prior to the start of the co-existence phase to ensure they obtain the relevant mandatory information from their customers to comply with the MX message format. For example, when a payment is being sent cross border on behalf of a domestic customer, and the domestic customer may need to provide more information than they have provided previously.</li>
                            <li>For information on expectations for participants acting as an intermediary agent please refer to Part D – MX Messaging Procedures.</li>

                            <li>If a participant needs to map MX messages to an MT message for their back office systems then they should be aware that truncation can occur and should refer to the PMPG guidelines for basic principles for mapping, prioritisation of elements and translation. SWIFT also provides translator and/or mapping libraries to define, map and validate HVCS instructions to and from any format including MX messages and MT messages.</li>
                            <li>There are two scenarios where truncation can occur when receiving a CBPR+ message with embedded MT message:</li>
