		is limited to cross border payments and does not currently monitor payments sent across local market infrastructure.</li>
                <li>The platform will ensure interoperability between users of different data formats and connectivity channels, but
		those that want to unlock the full benefits of richer data and advanced platform features will need to implement
		ISO 20022 and APIs.</li>
                <li>Intermediaries will be able to receive their choice of API, MX or MX with embedded MT for different back office
		system applications or purposes. If the embedded MT format is chosen, some loss of data may occur in the MT message
		itself, but full message details can be accessed via the Transaction Manager or in the MX portion of the message.</li>
                <li>Banks must maintain the ability to support cross-border MT traffic independently of the Transaction Manager until
		2025, although SWIFT may enhance the platform to include MT messaging in future.</li>

                <li>The RBNZ have decided to adopt the Distinguished Name (DN) structure for transport of FINplus / CBPR+ messages.</li>
                <li>To enable ISO 20022 to work for multiple use cases and independent of networks, the general convention is to use DNs
		to specify sender and receiver information. This will enable SWIFT to implement a consistency check between the
		Interact Headers and the Business Application Headers for the Sender and Receiver.</li>
                <li>The sender and receiver address in FIN message services will be based on BIC11. However, for InterAct messaging
		services, they will be based on DNs, namely Requestor DN and Responder DN. Further information can be accessed via
		SWIFT.com Knowledge Centre SWIFTNet Name and Addressing Guide.</li>
                <li>A DN follows a hierarchical naming principle and consists of LDAP attributes like cn (common name) ou
		(organizational unit) uid (user identifier) and o (organization). These are given in comma separated order of hierarchy
		whereby the left value is the lowest most local and specific identifier moving up to the value on the right which is the
		top-level parent e.g., cn=invfunds, ou=80a, o=creschzz, o=swift. All values should be written in lowercase.</li>
                <li>In the example below, the top level is SWIFT, followed by the BIC8 of the bank, and then specifying further levels to
		help route the message to the correct internal recipient of the bank.</li>

                <li>The pacs.004 return message is sent by an agent to the previous agent in the payment chain to return a payment previously settled.</li>
                <li>Payment returns may be the consequence of a payment cancellation requested by the instructing agent of the original payment message (solicited) or initiated by the original instructed agent as an unsolicited payment return.</li>
                <li>The pacs.004 return message structure is equivalent to the MT 103/103+ (customer credit transfer message) REJT/RETN and the MT202/202 COV (financial institution credit transfer message) REJT/RETN. A REJT/ RETN message is functionally like an unsolicited / solicited pacs.004, respectively.</li>
                <li>When using the pacs.004 return message, it is important to note the following:</li>
                <ol class="level2">
                    <li>Each pacs.004 return message must contain one HVCS return payment.</li>
                    <li>HVCS supports partial solicited payment returns with the use of multiple pacs.004 return messages to return an HVCS payment in instalments.</li>
                    <li>Unsolicited payment returns should be returned in a single return payment instruction.</li>
                    <li>The returned Interbank Settlement Amount could be different from the original Interbank Settlement Amount for cross border payments due to currency exchange or charge fees. Participants must be able to receive a returned Interbank Settlement Amount that is different from the original Interbank Settlement Amount. The instructed agent that sends the pacs.004 return message cannot deduct a fee from the amount of an HVCS payment before returning it.</li>
                    <li>The pacs.004 return message must be used to return an HVCS payment regardless of whether the return chain is the same as the original forward path or if it follows a different path.</li>
                    <li>Participants cannot use the pacs.004 return message to return a return HVCS payment. If returning an HVCS payment received in a pacs.004 return message, the original payment type, as referenced in the pacs.004 return message, should be used.</li>
                    <li>The pacs.004 return message does not cater for the Instruction for Next Agent element, so it is not possible to apply the ESAS conditional release options to a pacs.004 return message.</li>
                    <li>Original parties of the underlying pacs.008, pacs.009, pacs.009 COV payment are reversed in the pacs.004 return message relative to the original payment. ie. the debtor of original payment becomes the creditor in the pacs.004 return message and the creditor of the original payment becomes the debtor in the pacs.004 return message.</li>
                    <ol class="level3">
                        <li>A participant acting as an Intermediary agent, and on-return cross border payment may find new ISO 20022 return reason codes, which are not parts of HVCS reason codes.</li>
                    </ol>
                </ol>
                <li>The pacs.004 return message is passed from one participant to another participant serially, as shown in the diagram below.</li>
                <li>The pacs.004 return message uses a number of elements to capture details from the underlying payment it is returning, which are nested within the Original Group Information and Transaction Information elements. The pacs.004 return message relates to the original payment instruction through references / identifiers in conjunction with attributes from the original payment instruction. A number of these elements are mandatory within the HVCS to ensure the pacs.004 return message conveys sufficient details to the instructed agent.</li>
                <li>When returning a payment by the cover method, the pacs.004 return message follows the path of the pacs.009 COV payment message as shown below:</li>
                <li>Again, the pacs.004 return message is sent serially between banks, this time referencing the pacs.009 COV payment message within the Original Group Information and Transaction Information elements of the pacs.004 return message. The information of the underlying pacs.008 payment message for which cover is provided must be captured in the Underlying Customer Credit Transfer elements.</li>
                <li>When acting as intermediary, upon receipt of a pacs.004 return message, that requires on-sending, the same path is to be taken regardless of whether the return originated domestically or cross-border.</li>
                <li>In some scenarios, for example if the intermediary bank was not involved in the original forward path, the intermediary may not have access to the original message details and must seek them in order to correctly populate the domestic pacs.004 return message.</li>

                <ol class="level2">
                    <li>The HVCS operates on the SWIFTNet Copy Service in a mandatory partial Y-Copy mode for the following message types; pacs.008, pacs.009 (CORE/COV) and pacs.004.</li>
                    <li>In Y-Copy mode, SWIFT intercepts the pacs.008, pacs.009 (CORE/COV) and pacs.004 messages (flow 1) and copies prescribed fields from these payment messages to the destination, RBNZ (flow 2), using the xcop.001 message. More information is available on the Reserve Bank&apos;s Confluence website, here.</li>
                    <li>SWIFT holds the payment message in a temporary queue until the RBNZ sends the appropriate authorisation or rejection (flow 3) using the xsys.001 message.</li>
                    <li>If the RBNZ authorises the payment message, SWIFT releases and forwards the pacs.008 / pacs.009 (CORE/COV) / pacs.004 message for delivery to the instructed agent. SWIFT notifies settlement to the sender using the xsys.002 message (flow 4) and for the instructed agent, includes the settlement information in the SWIFTNet Header of the payment message (flow 4) using the third-party to receiver element.</li>
                    <li>As part of the normal InterAct features, the sender can request that SWIFT monitors the delivery of sent messages (flow 5). In this case, SWIFT returns an xsys.010 Non-Delivery Warning or an xsys.011 Delivery Notification, or both, to the sender, as appropriate. These notifications are based on the delivery of the original message to its receiver, and not on the delivery of the copy to the RBNZ.</li>
