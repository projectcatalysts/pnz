            <ol class="level1">
                <li>The introduction of MX messages to the High Value Clearing System (HVCS) introduces new ISO standard terms.  Readers familiar with the previous Appendix 14 will note that many of the terms used previously by the NZ payments industry have been replaced with their ISO equivalents in both the HVCS rules and procedures.</li>
                <li>There are also many places where MT specific terms have been replaced by message system agnostic terms.  This is necessary to prepare for the removal of MT messaging from November 2025.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

            <div class="clause-heading" data-number="1.2">Terminology Venn Diagram</div>
            <ol class="level1">
                <li>This diagram shows the relationship between the standards documents and also the relationship between key terms.</li>
                <li>The Rules Part 19.1 should be referenced for definitions of all the terms within the diagram.</li>
                <li>Additional definition of the specific message types and their use can be found in the HVCS Common Procedures Section at clause 1.1.</li>

            <div class="clause-heading" data-number="1.3">Senders / Receivers / Instructing Agents / Instructed Agents</div>
            <ol class="level1">
                <li>ISO 20022 introduces the terms instructing agent and instructed agent.  These terms are used to describe the role of an HVCS participant in relation to a payment message that flows across the HVCS.  During settlement, the instructing agent’s ESAS account is debited, and the instructed agent’s ESAS account is credited.</li>
                <li>Instructing agent and instructed agent are payment message specific terms.  When referencing the wider scope of HVCS Instructions (inclusive of exception and investigation messages and system messages), the terms sender and receiver are used, whereby the sender is the entity that constructs the exception and investigation message or system message and requests message delivery from SWIFT (or in some circumstances is SWIFT itself), and the receiver is the recipient entity.  The sender and receiver of the exception and investigation message and system message are represented within the From and To fields of the Business Application Header.</li>

            <ol class="level1">
                <li>For a payment message like an SCP, in which the funds are ‘pushed’ from a customer’s account, the debtor gives a payment instruction to the debtor agent directly and communicates the information required by the debtor agent, for example:</li>
                <ol class="level2">
                    <li>the amount and the date of the HVCS payment,</li>

                    <li>a way of identifying the creditor agent, and</li>
                    <li>the account name and the account number to be credited with the amount of the HVCS payment.</li>
                </ol>
                <li>The payment instruction is usually authenticated (e.g. for an SCP with a log on password for internet banking) allowing the debtor agent to confirm that the payment instruction comes from a secure source.</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="clause-heading" data-number="2.4"></div>

        <div>The HVCS is used to make large payments quickly. HVCS payments are:</div>
        <ol class="level2">
            <li>fast; and</li>
            <li>irrevocable</li>
        </ol>
        <div>an HVCS payment cannot be reversed by the instructing agent after settlement, and</div>
        <div>if the creditor’s account is credited with the amount of the HVCS payment, the instructed agent cannot reverse the HVCS payment.</div>

            <ol class="level1">
                <li>The HVCS uses two SWIFT message formats that have been defined for New Zealand’s HVCS. They are:</li>
                <ol class="level2">
                    <li>MX message format (ISO 20022)</li>
                    <li>MT message format (ISO 15022)</li>
                </ol>
                <li>MX messages are an XML-based replacement for MT messages which will be retired at the end of the co-existence phase (scheduled for November 2025).</li>
                <li>Further information on how to send and receive HVCS instructions in either format is provided in the respective procedures:</li>
